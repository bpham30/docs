PeerPop offers two ways to import your events from other platforms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Eventbrite Integration" icon="link" href="#eventbrite-integration">
    Connect your Eventbrite account and sync event details and ticket sales automatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="External Link Import" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" href="#external-link-import">
    Create a PeerPop listing that redirects to your existing checkout page
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Eventbrite Integration
If you're already using Eventbrite to sell tickets, you can connect your account and import your Eventbrite events. 

The ticket sales and event details will sync automatically and you can use PeerPop's marketing tools to promote your event.

### Getting Started
<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Eventbrite Account">
    Click the **Eventbrite** option after clicking **"Import from another platform"**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Allow Access">
    Log in to your Eventbrite account and allow PeerPop access to your events
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events">
    You'll be redirected to the Import Events page where you can choose which events you want to import to PeerPop. 
    <Note>
      You will need to create an event on Eventbrite before you can import it to PeerPop. For best results, we recommend creating your event on PeerPop instead.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure PeerPop Features">
    Set up PeerPop marketing features:

  </Step>
</Steps>

## External Link Import
For events hosted on other ticketing platforms, you can create a PeerPop listing that redirects to your existing checkout page.
